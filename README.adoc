= Java interview test

The project is used to generate sheets with questions and answers to recruitment interviews.

Two sets of outputs are generated

- docs with questions
- docs with questions and answers

The questions contain java code snippets, answers are std output.
The question and answer generation logic uses the JUnit framework -- code snippets with questions are basically parts of test classes.
The std output from the tests are used to generate the output.
